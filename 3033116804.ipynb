However, to solve this issue, we used the probability of〈UNK〉which is in a nonzero (in this dataset). With these changes, our perplexities on the training and dev datasets become much more reasonable. However, there is a higher perplexity on the dev dataset in comparison to perplexity on the training dataset."

However, in this section, we experiment with adjusting k to less significant values, namely 0.5, 0.05, and 0.01.
